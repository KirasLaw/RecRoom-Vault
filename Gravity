when you're in your dorm on CE go to float and search -9.81 there should be around 300 values just use ctrl-a to select all of them and change them,
you can mess around with this a little bit to see how it works but changing it to 0 you float without moving up or down.
Positive numbers make go up,
and negative numbers make go down.
if you jump with a high number you teleport.

Credits; I have 0 clue sorry! :3 xd
